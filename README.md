## 🔧 How It Works
1️⃣ **Copy File Links**: Copy all file links from a Google Drive folder and paste them into a text file.  
2️⃣ **Automated Processing**: The script automatically downloads, preprocesses, and prepares the data.  
3️⃣ **Model Training & Testing**: The processed data is then used for model training and evaluation.
