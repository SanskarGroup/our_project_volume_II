## 🎨 Enhanced Visualization with Modern CSS
To improve the readability and visual appeal of this README, we suggest using modern CSS styling:

```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    background: linear-gradient(120deg, #a1c4fd, #c2e9fb);
    color: #333;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  h1, h2, h3 {
    color: #ff6b6b;
  }
  code {
    background: #2d2d2d;
    color: #f8f8f8;
    padding: 6px;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
  pre {
    background: #1e1e1e;
    color: #00d9ff;
    padding: 12px;
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
</style>
```

## 🔧 How It Works
1. **Copy File Links**: Copy all file links from a Google Drive folder and paste them into a text file.
2. **Automated Processing**: The script automatically downloads, preprocesses, and prepares the data.
3. **Model Training & Testing**: The data is then fed into the ML pipeline for training and evaluation.
